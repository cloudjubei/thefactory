# WHAT:
- Each project, this one included, can be split into two parts -> the specification and the implementation.
- The specification defines what the project does, so that anyone - be it an AI agent or a human can read it and implement the details.
- Thus the implementation is a solution to the specification.
- Given an adequate enough specification, it should be possible to achieve a replicable result no matter how someone implements it. This is akin to scientists defining experiments that can be verified by anyone else. 
- This is what Specification Programming (SP) is. It's the focus on the WHAT - the final result.

# CORE IDEAS:
- This project is a framework/factor/foundry that produces solutions to other problems.
- This project will write the best possible specification for a given problem so that other problems can be solved.
- This project is self-referrential - it will keep on improving its own specification and its own methods, so that other projects will benefit.
- This project is programming language agnostic. It grows with its use cases and tries to find solutions specific to given problems. If a new better solution appears then it will execute on it.
- This project uses Git for source control.

# STEPS TO FOLLOW:
- Read TASKS.md and work on the first pending task. A task starts with a number, right round bracket and a status symbol. "+" means it's done, "~" means it's in progress, "-" means it's pending. "42) ~ Some task description" would indicate that task 42 is being worked on by someone.
