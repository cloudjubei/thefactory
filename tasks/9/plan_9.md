# Plan for Task 9: Running specific tasks and features

## Intent
Enable orchestrator support for executing a specific task and feature via CLI flags and appropriate prompting. This capability will be integrated into Task 7 and this task removed after completion.

## Context
- Specs: docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md, tasks/7/plan_7.md

## Features
9.1) CLI flags -t/-f
   Action: Orchestrator accepts -t {task_id} and optional -f {feature_id} and constructs a prompt referencing tasks/plan_{task_id}.md.
   Acceptance: Running the script executes the specified task/feature and outputs the result.
   Dependencies: Task 7 (orchestrator)

9.2) Branch naming
   Action: Use branch names features/{task_id}_{feature_id} or tasks/{task_id} as applicable.
   Acceptance: Branch names follow the convention when submitting work.
   Context: docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md

9.3) Integrate into Task 7
   Action: Move this functionality into Task 7 as a feature and remove Task 9 once complete.
   Acceptance: Task 9 is removed after Task 7 is implemented.

## Execution Steps
1) Implement via Task 7 per tasks/7/plan_7.md
2) After verification, remove Task 9 from tasks/TASKS.md
3) Submit for review under Task 7
4) Finish
