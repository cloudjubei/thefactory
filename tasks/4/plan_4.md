# Plan for Task 4: Specification documentation

## Intent
Analyze and document the specification format and its requirements for clarity and completeness.

## Context
- Specs: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/TESTING.md
- Source files: tasks/TASKS.md

## Features
4.1) + Create the Specification Guide
   Action: Author docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md with problem statement, inputs/outputs, constraints, success criteria, edge cases, pitfalls, and checklist.
   Acceptance:
   - docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md exists and includes the defined sections
   Output: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md

4.2) - Provide TEMPLATE.md with examples for all sections
   Action: Create docs/TEMPLATE.md that includes all required sections from docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md with placeholder examples.
   Acceptance:
   - docs/TEMPLATE.md exists with required headings and example content
   Output: docs/TEMPLATE.md
   Notes: Enhancement noted in Task 4; not part of original acceptance.

4.3) / Write tests for Specification docs
   Action: Add tests under tasks/4/tests/ to verify presence and required sections in SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md and TEMPLATE.md.
   Acceptance:
   - Tests assert existence and headings
   Dependencies: 9.1
   Notes: Legacy task; tests to be implemented under Task 9.

## Execution Steps
- Complete 4.2 in future iteration; tests to be delivered via Task 9.
