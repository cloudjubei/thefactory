# Plan for Task 4: Specification documentation

Task Reference: See tasks/TASKS.md entry 4.

## Intent
Deliver a concise, specification-driven plan that ensures the specification guide and template exist, docs/SPEC.md adheres to the guide, and tests validate these outputs. This plan follows PLAN_SPECIFICATION and FEATURE_FORMAT and uses a test-driven approach.

## Context
- Specs: docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/TESTING.md, docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
- Target docs: docs/SPEC.md, docs/TEMPLATE.md
- Task list: tasks/TASKS.md

## Features
4.1) + Create the specification guide
   Action: Provide a comprehensive guide to writing specifications.
   Acceptance: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md exists and covers Problem Statement, Inputs and Outputs, Constraints, Success Criteria, Edge Cases, Examples.
   Context: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   Output: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md

4.2) + Provide a template with examples
   Action: Create a template with all required sections and example content per the guide.
   Acceptance: docs/TEMPLATE.md exists with placeholders and example snippets for all sections required by docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md.
   Context: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   Dependencies: 4.1
   Output: docs/TEMPLATE.md

4.3) + Ensure docs/SPEC.md adheres to the guide
   Action: Align docs/SPEC.md with the guide structure and section requirements.
   Acceptance:
   - docs/SPEC.md exists and includes sections: Problem Statement, Inputs and Outputs, Constraints, Success Criteria, Edge Cases, Examples
   - Section order and intent match docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   - No extraneous sections superseding these core sections remain
   Context: docs/SPEC.md, docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
   Notes: Current SPEC used (WHAT, CORE IDEAS, ACTIONS); ensure realignment to the guide.
   Output: Updated docs/SPEC.md

4.4) + Tests for 4.1 and 4.2 (Guide and Template)
   Action: Write tests that verify both docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md and docs/TEMPLATE.md exist and include the required section headings.
   Acceptance:
   - tasks/4/tests/test_4_4.py exists
   - The test checks that docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md and docs/TEMPLATE.md exist
   - The test verifies presence of the headings: "# Problem Statement", "# Inputs and Outputs", "# Constraints", "# Success Criteria", "# Edge Cases", "# Examples"
   - Test passes via run_tests
   Context: docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md (Testing), docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md, docs/TEMPLATE.md
   Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
   Output: tasks/4/tests/test_4_4.py
   Notes: Tests cover the guide and template concurrently.

4.5) - Test for 4.3 (SPEC.md adherence)
   Action: Write a test that verifies docs/SPEC.md adheres to the guide.
   Acceptance:
   - tasks/4/tests/test_4_5.py exists
   - The test checks that docs/SPEC.md exists and includes the headings: "# Problem Statement", "# Inputs and Outputs", "# Constraints", "# Success Criteria", "# Edge Cases", "# Examples"
   - The test can include additional checks (e.g., non-empty sections) if practical and deterministic
   - Test passes via run_tests
   Context: docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md (Testing), docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md, docs/SPEC.md
   Dependencies: 4.3
   Output: tasks/4/tests/test_4_5.py

## Execution Steps
For each feature in order:
1) Gather context (MCC) using retrieve_context_files for the plan, referenced specs, and target files
2) Implement the feature changes (create or update files)
3) Create test(s) under tasks/4/tests/ validating the featureâ€™s acceptance criteria
4) Run tests with run_tests and ensure they pass
5) Call finish_feature with a descriptive message when the feature is complete

## Administrative Steps
1) After all features are completed, run run_tests again to confirm the whole suite passes
2) Update tasks/TASKS.md to reflect Task 4 status
3) Submit for review (open PR)
4) Finish
