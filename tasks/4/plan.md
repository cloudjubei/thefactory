# Plan for Task 4: Plan specification

## Intent
Create and maintain the specification-driven plan for Task 4, ensuring it adheres to docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md and uses the feature format from docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md. This plan documents how the task's acceptance criteria are met.

## Context
- Specs: docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md
- Admin: tasks/TASKS.md
- Outputs referenced: docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md

## Features
4.1) + Create the Feature Format specification
   Action: Provide a dedicated specification for describing features so plans can reference and structure them consistently.
   Acceptance:
   - docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md exists
   - The document includes Purpose, Where Features Live, Format, Field Definitions, and Examples
   - The format references project specs and avoids duplicating implementation details
   Context: docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   Output: docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md
   Notes: Enables consistent plan authoring across tasks.

4.2) + Create the Plan Specification
   Action: Document purpose, principles, structure, template, and example for plans, referencing docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md.
   Acceptance:
   - docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md exists and includes purpose, principles, structure, template, and example
   - The document references docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md
   Context: docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md
   Dependencies: 4.1
   Output: docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md

## Execution Steps
For each feature in order:
1) Gather MCC using retrieve_context_files for the plan and referenced specs
2) Implement the feature’s change (author/update the specified doc)
3) Create tests under tasks/5/tests/ verifying the feature acceptance criteria (file existence and required sections)
4) Run tests via run_tests and ensure they pass; then call finish_feature for the feature

After all features are completed:
5) Run run_tests again and ensure the full suite passes
6) Update tasks/TASKS.md with the task’s status if changed
7) Submit for review (open PR)
8) Finish
