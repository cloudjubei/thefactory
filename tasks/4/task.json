To achieve this, we define the following sub-features with their implementation steps:\n\nSub-feature 4.1: Create Dockerfile\nDescription: Write a Dockerfile to build the application image.\nSteps:\n1. Start with a base image, e.g., FROM python:3.9-slim.\n2. Set the working directory, e.g., WORKDIR /app.\n3. Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies: COPY requirements.txt . then RUN pip install -r requirements.txt.\n4. Copy the application code: COPY . .\n5. Expose necessary ports, e.g., EXPOSE 80.\n6. Set the entrypoint, e.g., CMD ['python', 'app.py'].\n\nSub-feature 4.2: Create .dockerignore file\nDescription: Create a .dockerignore file to optimize the build context by excluding unnecessary files.\nSteps:\n1. Create a file named .dockerignore in the project root.\n2. Add patterns like: __pycache__ , *.pyc , .git , .env , etc.\n\nSub-feature 4.3: Document Docker usage\nDescription: Update the README.md with instructions for building and running the Docker image.\nSteps:\n1. Add a section 'Running in Docker' to README.md.\n2. Include commands: docker build -t myapp . \n3. docker run -d -p 80:80 --name myapp-container myapp\n4. Explain any environment variables or volume mounts needed.\n\nThis plan outlines the necessary sub-features and steps to fully implement running the application in Docker."
