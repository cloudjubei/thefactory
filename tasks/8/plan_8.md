# Plan for Task 8: Cleanup

## Intent
This plan addresses Task 8 by reviewing all specification documents, tasks, and plans to ensure they are consistent and adhere to their defined formats. This improves project clarity and maintainability.

## Context
- Specs: `docs/TASK_FORMAT.md`, `docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md`, `docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md`
- Files to be modified: `docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md`, `tasks/7/plan_7.md`

## Features
8.1) - Standardize Feature Format Example
   Action: Update the example in `docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md` to include a status marker, making it a complete and consistent example.
   Acceptance: The "Completed Feature" example in `docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md` starts with `13.1) +`.
   Output: `docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md`

8.2) - Correct and Align Orchestrator Plan
   Action: Update `tasks/7/plan_7.md` to correct a typo, align a feature description with the actual implementation, and add a missing section as required by the planning specification.
   Acceptance:
   - In `tasks/7/plan_7.md`, the typo "Depdendencies" is corrected to "Dependencies".
   - The action for feature 7.12 is updated to reflect the orchestrator's branch management.
   - The plan includes the "Administrative Steps" section.
   Output: `tasks/7/plan_7.md`

8.3) - Finalize Cleanup Task
   Action: Mark the cleanup task as complete in the main task list.
   Acceptance: The status of Task 8 in `tasks/TASKS.md` is changed from `-` to `+`.
   Output: `tasks/TASKS.md`
