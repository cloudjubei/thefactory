# Plan for Task 8: Tests specification

## Intent
This plan is to create the testing specification document. This document will define the framework and methodology for verifying the agent's functionality, ensuring its behavior is correct and predictable.

## Context
- Specs: `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md`

## Features
8.1) - Define Testing Specification
   Action: Create the `docs/TESTING.md` document that outlines the complete testing strategy for the agent.
   Acceptance:
   - `docs/TESTING.md` exists.
   - The document details the testing philosophy and different types of tests (Unit, Integration, E2E).
   - It specifies a clear structure for test cases, including setup, mock agent responses, and assertions.
   - It proposes a YAML format for defining test cases.
   - It outlines the workflow for creating and running tests.
   Output: `docs/TESTING.md`

## Execution Steps
1) Create the `docs/TESTING.md` file with the detailed specification.
2) Update `tasks/TASKS.md` to mark Task 8 as complete.
3) Submit for review.
4) Finish.
