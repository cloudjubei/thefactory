# Plan for Task 8: Tests specification

## Intent
To establish a clear and mandatory testing framework for the project. This involves creating a specification document for how tests are written and located, and integrating this testing requirement directly into the core planning process to ensure all features are verifiable.

## Context
- Specs: `docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md`, `docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md`

## Features
8.1) - Create the testing specification document
   Action: Create a new specification document that defines the philosophy, location, structure, and workflow for writing tests for the agent's work.
   Acceptance: The file `docs/TESTING.md` exists and contains the required sections detailing the project's testing strategy.
   Output: `docs/TESTING.md`

8.2) - Integrate testing into the planning specification
   Action: Update the `docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md` to make testing a mandatory part of the feature development workflow.
   Acceptance:
   - `docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md` includes a new principle, "Test-Driven Acceptance".
   - The plan template in `docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md` is updated to show an example of a feature followed by its corresponding test feature.
   Context: `docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`
   Dependencies: 8.1
   Output: `docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md`

## Execution Steps
1) Create the `docs/TESTING.md` file.
2) Update the `docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md` file to include the testing workflow.
3) Update `tasks/TASKS.md` to mark this task as complete.
4) Submit the work for review.
5) Finish the cycle.
