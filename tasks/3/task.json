  "description": "Create a new structure for child projects that stems from this project. This will be done by creating a new repository for each child project. Each child project is linked backed to this projct via git-submodules so that all the child projects are automatically updated whenever this project updates. This project drives the child projects and then the child projects can also be cloned independently if needed and will drive their own implementation work. The first project is `Docker`. We want to be able to run any project (including this + any child project) in a docker environment. It needs to be extremely easy to launch this - ideally a single function call to get it launched and then whatever function call needs to be called inside the running container. As a first example we should be able to launch this project in docker and call `run.py` to launch an agent exactly as defined in `LOCAL_SETUP.md`. There needs to be a step-by-step guide for this that exactly explains it.",

      "plan": "Goal: Ensure the main repo ignores the projects/ directory and its contents, while continuing to manage child projects as git submodules. Provide clear documentation and optional helper scripts for consistent submodule workflows.\n\nImplementation Plan:\n1) Audit current state\n   - Check .gitignore for existing rules affecting projects/.\n   - Identify any tracked files under projects/ that are not submodule gitlinks: git ls-files projects/.\n   - Confirm .gitmodules is present (if submodules already exist) and not ignored.\n\n2) Update .gitignore\n   - Add the rule at repo root: /projects/\n   - Add an explanatory comment above the rule:\n     # Ignore local child projects folder (managed as git submodules)\n     /projects/\n   - Ensure .gitmodules remains tracked (no rule should ignore it; only add !/.gitmodules if a very broad ignore exists).\n\n3) Remediation for tracked content (if needed)\n   - If any normal files in projects/ are tracked (not submodules), untrack them: git rm -r --cached projects/<offending-path> and commit, or convert them into submodules as appropriate.\n   - Do not remove submodule gitlinks. Validate submodules via: git ls-files --stage | grep 160000 to see gitlinks.\n\n4) Commit and validation\n   - Commit the .gitignore change with a clear message, e.g., \"chore(git): ignore projects/ folder used for submodules\".\n   - Local validation:\n     - Create a temporary file projects/_ignore_check.tmp and run git status; it should not appear.\n     - If existing submodules exist under projects/, verify they remain recognized: git submodule status shows entries and git status does not list untracked content from submodules.\n\n5) Documentation\n   - Add a dedicated doc (docs/submodules.md) explaining:\n     - What the projects/ folder is for and why it's ignored.\n     - How to clone and initialize submodules: git submodule update --init --recursive.\n     - How to add a new child project: git submodule add --name <name> <url> projects/<name>; commit .gitmodules and the gitlink.\n     - How to update a child project and record the new commit in the parent repo.\n     - How to remove a child project submodule safely.\n     - Common pitfalls and troubleshooting (e.g., detached HEAD, syncing URLs).\n   - Link this doc from README.md for discoverability.\n\n6) Helper scripts (optional but recommended)\n   - scripts/submodules-init.sh: Initialize and update submodules (set executable; include usage help). Commands: git submodule sync --recursive && git submodule update --init --recursive.\n   - scripts/submodule-add.sh: Adds a new submodule under projects/<name>, validates input, optionally sets branch, and commits .gitmodules + gitlink.\n   - scripts/submodules-sync.sh: Sync submodule URLs recursively.\n   - Document usage of these scripts in docs/submodules.md.\n\n7) CI/CD considerations (conditional)\n   - If CI exists, ensure steps that do not require submodules skip cloning/updating them to speed pipelines, or explicitly run submodule init/update when needed. Ensure any caches ignore projects/.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- .gitignore at repo root includes /projects/ with an explanatory comment.\n- Creating a new file under projects/ does not show up in git status.\n- Existing submodules under projects/ still function; git submodule status shows expected entries.\n- docs/submodules.md exists and is linked from README.md with clear, actionable instructions.\n- Helper scripts (if included) exist, are executable, and their usage is documented."

      "plan": "Implementation plan for feature 3.1: Update .gitignore to ignore projects/ directory and contents\n\n1) Preparation\n- Confirm the repository uses a top-level directory named \"projects\" for child projects.\n- Decide whether the repository must keep an empty projects/ directory tracked (e.g., via a .gitkeep). If not required, ignore everything. If required, add an exception for a single placeholder file.\n\n2) Update .gitignore\n- Locate the root .gitignore file. If it does not exist, create it at the repository root.\n- Open .gitignore and add a new section (avoid duplicating existing rules):\n  # Ignore child projects directory\n  /projects/\n- Notes:\n  - Use forward slashes; Git ignores are POSIX-style regardless of OS.\n  - The leading slash scopes the rule to the repository root so only the top-level projects/ is ignored.\n\n3) Optional: keep a placeholder tracked (only if needed)\n- If the team requires the directory to exist in the repo while ignoring its contents, add an exception rule under the above lines:\n  !/projects/.gitkeep\n- Do NOT add this exception unless we also intend to commit a projects/.gitkeep file in a separate task. This feature only adjusts .gitignore.\n\n4) Validate locally\n- Create a temporary file for verification: echo \"test\" > projects/_ignore_me.txt\n- Run: git status\n  - Expected: projects/_ignore_me.txt should not appear in the status output.\n- If an exception for .gitkeep was added in step 3, create an empty projects/.gitkeep and run: git add projects/.gitkeep\n  - Expected: .gitkeep is tracked while all other files under projects/ remain ignored.\n- Optionally run: git check-ignore -v projects/_ignore_me.txt to confirm the rule and source line.\n\n5) Edge cases and conflicts\n- Ensure there are no un-ignore rules (e.g., !/projects/*) elsewhere in .gitignore that would counteract this.\n- If prior rules existed for projects/, consolidate into a single clear rule to avoid confusion.\n\n6) Documentation\n- Update developer docs/README (in a separate docs task if necessary) to clarify that all child projects live under projects/ and are ignored by default.\n\n7) Acceptance criteria\n- .gitignore contains an entry that ignores the top-level projects/ directory and all its contents.\n- Creating files under projects/ does not show them in git status.\n- No unintended files outside projects/ are affected.\n\n8) Rollback plan\n- If needed, remove the /projects/ rule from .gitignore and commit the change.\n- Run git rm -r --cached projects/ to re-track the directory and its contents if previously ignored.",
