  "title": "New child projects structure",
  "action": "Create a new structure for child projects that stems from this project. This will be done by creating a new repository for each child project. Each child project is linked backed to this projct via git-submodules so that all the child projects are automatically updated whenever this project updates. This project drives the child projects and then the child projects can also be cloned independently if needed and will drive their own implementation work. This project will only oversee their specification correctness.",
  "acceptance": [
    "The file `docs/CHILD_PROJECTS_SPECIFICATION.md` exists detailing the structure of child projects stemming from this project. There is a folder called `projects` where all the child projects are stored. Each child project has its own repository and is linked to this one via git submodules. This project's `.gitignore` needs to be updated so it ignores the `projects` folder and all the files inside it."
