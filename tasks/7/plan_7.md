# Plan for Task 7: Agent Orchestrator

## Intent
Create a script that functions as the Agent's Orchestrator for direct interaction with an LLM agent.

## Context
- Specs: docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md
- Source files: scripts/run_local_agent.py (expected)

## Features
7.1) + Create Orchestrator script
   Action: Implement scripts/run_local_agent.py to parse agent JSON and execute tools.
   Acceptance:
   - A script exists that allows interaction with an agent in compliance with TOOL_ARCHITECTURE
   Output: scripts/run_local_agent.py

7.2) / Write tests for Orchestrator behavior
   Action: Add tests under tasks/7/tests/ (or under task 9 scope) to validate basic tool dispatch and error handling.
   Acceptance:
   - Tests cover JSON parsing and tool execution paths
   Dependencies: 9.1
   Notes: Legacy task; tests to be implemented under Task 9.

## Execution Steps
- Backfilled; tests deferred to Task 9. Task 10 will later merge this with Task 6 per instructions.
