# Plan for Task 7: Agent Orchestrator

## Intent
Implement the local orchestrator script and setup, fully compliant with AGENT_PRINCIPLES and TOOL_ARCHITECTURE, including CLI options to run specific tasks/features and supporting local setup.

## Context
- Specs: docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md, docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md
- Outputs: scripts/run_local_agent.py, requirements.txt, .env.example, docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md

## Features
7.1) Implement orchestrator script
   Action: Create scripts/run_local_agent.py that parses the agent's JSON, executes tools, and supports Single/Continuous modes.
   Acceptance: Behavior matches docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md.
   Output: scripts/run_local_agent.py

7.2) Dependency specification
   Action: Create requirements.txt listing all external libraries used by scripts/run_local_agent.py.
   Acceptance: requirements.txt exists and installs cleanly.
   Output: requirements.txt

7.3) Environment variables template
   Action: Provide .env.example containing placeholders for required API keys and settings.
   Acceptance: .env.example exists and documents each variable.
   Output: .env.example

7.4) Local setup guide
   Action: Author docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md with setup and execution instructions.
   Acceptance: docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md exists and is accurate.
   Output: docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md

7.5) Run specific task/feature
   Action: Add CLI options -t {task_id} and -f {feature_id} to run specific tasks/features via prompt construction referencing tasks/plan_{task_id}.md.
   Acceptance: Orchestrator accepts -t and optional -f and executes accordingly; output confirms execution.
   Context: tasks/9/plan_9.md

7.6) Branch naming conventions
   Action: Ensure PR branch naming follows tasks/{task_id} or features/{task_id}_{feature_id}.
   Acceptance: submit_for_review uses correct naming.
   Context: docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md

7.7) Consolidate Task 9 and remove it
   Action: Integrate the functionality described by Task 9 and then remove Task 9 from tasks/TASKS.md.
   Acceptance: Task 9 is removed after 7.5 is implemented.
   Dependencies: 7.5

## Execution Steps
1) Implement files and features 7.1â€“7.6
2) Remove Task 9 from tasks/TASKS.md after successful 7.5
3) Update tasks/TASKS.md to mark Task 7 complete
4) Submit for review
5) Finish
