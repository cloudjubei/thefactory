# Plan for Task 12: Local app

## Intent
Create a complete specification document for the Local App in this repository, guiding the setup of a separate Local App repository. Provide tests and mark the task complete per acceptance criteria.

## Context
- Specs: docs/SPEC.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md, docs/TESTING.md
- Source files: tasks/TASKS.md

## Features
12.1) + Author the Local App specification
   Action: Create docs/LOCAL_APP.md describing the Local App project, including purpose, constraints, architecture options, repository bootstrap steps, MVP success criteria, integration with this project, and an initial backlog for the new repo.
   Acceptance:
   - docs/LOCAL_APP.md exists
   - Document includes: References, Problem Statement, Constraints, MVP Success Criteria, Architecture Options, Repository Bootstrap, Data Model/Parsing Rules, Integration, Initial Task Backlog, Notes
   - The document states that the Local App is a separate repository that follows this project's principles
   Context: docs/SPEC.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/FILE_ORGANISATION.md, docs/TESTING.md
   Output: docs/LOCAL_APP.md

12.2) + Test: Local App specification exists and contains key sections
   Action: Create a test script that verifies the existence of docs/LOCAL_APP.md and checks for key headings.
   Acceptance:
   - tasks/12/tests/test_feature_1.py exists
   - Running it would PASS if docs/LOCAL_APP.md exists and includes defined sections
   Context: docs/TESTING.md
   Output: tasks/12/tests/test_feature_1.py

## Execution Steps
1) Create docs/LOCAL_APP.md (Feature 12.1)
2) Create tasks/12/tests/test_feature_1.py (Feature 12.2)
3) Update tasks/TASKS.md to mark Task 12 as completed
4) Submit for review and finish
