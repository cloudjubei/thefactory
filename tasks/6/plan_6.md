# Plan for Task 6: Agent Principles and Orchestrator (Merged)

## Intent
Unify the specification and implementation for the Agent and its Orchestrator under a single task. This consolidates the definitions and the runnable entry point so future work references one canonical task for all agent-related foundations.

## Context
- Specs: docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md, docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/TESTING.md, docs/SPEC.md
- Source files: scripts/run_local_agent.py

## Features
6.1) + Define Core Agent Terminology and Principles
   Action: Provide a specification that defines the high-level principles and the key terms "Agent" and "Orchestrator".
   Acceptance:
   - docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md exists
   - Document defines "The Agent" and "The Orchestrator" and the core principles
   Context: docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md
   Output: docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md

6.2) + Implement Agent Orchestrator Script
   Action: Provide a script that allows interaction with an agent using the tool-based architecture.
   Acceptance:
   - scripts/run_local_agent.py exists
   - Script exposes tools described in docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md and can drive a cycle
   Context: docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md, scripts/run_local_agent.py
   Output: scripts/run_local_agent.py

6.3) + Test: Verify Agent Principles Spec
   Action: Add a test that ensures the agent principles document exists and contains the required sections/terms.
   Acceptance:
   - tasks/6/tests/test_6_3.py exists
   - Test passes and verifies presence of key sections/terms
   Context: docs/TESTING.md, docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md
   Output: tasks/6/tests/test_6_3.py

6.4) + Test: Verify Orchestrator Script Presence
   Action: Add a test that ensures the orchestrator script exists and contains core classes/identifiers used to run the agent.
   Acceptance:
   - tasks/6/tests/test_6_4.py exists
   - Test passes and verifies presence of core classes/identifiers
   Context: docs/TESTING.md, scripts/run_local_agent.py
   Output: tasks/6/tests/test_6_4.py

## Execution Steps
For each feature:
1) Gather MCC using retrieve_context_files (implicitly followed here) and ensure files exist
2) Implement or verify required files
3) Add tests under tasks/6/tests/
4) Run tests
After all features:
5) Ensure full test suite passes
6) Update tasks/TASKS.md to merge tasks 6 & 7 and remove task 10
7) Submit for review
8) Finish
