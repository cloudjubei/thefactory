Define the high-level principles and key terms (Orchestrator and Agent) for the tool-based architecture, ensuring a clear contract.

## Context

- Source files: tasks/TASKS.md

## Features
6.1) + Create Agent Principles documentation
   Action: Author docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md defining terms and core principles.
   Acceptance:
   - docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md exists and defines Agent, Orchestrator, and core principles
   Output: docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md

6.2) / Write tests for Agent Principles
   Action: Add a test under tasks/6/tests/ verifying the document exists and includes key terms and principles.
   Acceptance:
   - Test asserts existence and keywords
   Dependencies: 9.1
   Notes: Legacy task; tests to be implemented under Task 9.

## Execution Steps
- Backfilled; tests deferred to Task 9.
