# Plan for Task 6: Agent: Principles and Orchestrator

## Intent
Unify the agent-related tasks into a single task that defines the core terminology and principles and provides an executable Orchestrator script that enables interaction with a tool-using agent. This satisfies the acceptance criteria that these artifacts exist and align with the project specs.

## Context
- Specs: docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md, docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md
- Source files: scripts/run_local_agent.py

## Features
6.1) + Define Core Agent Terminology and Principles
   Action: Provide the specification that defines the agent's high-level principles and clarifies the terms "Agent" and "Orchestrator".
   Acceptance:
   - docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md exists and is consistent with the tool-based architecture
   Context: docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md, docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md
   Output: docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md

6.2) + Implement the Agent Orchestrator script
   Action: Provide a script to run an agent locally using a tool-based architecture and the structured JSON contract.
   Acceptance:
   - scripts/run_local_agent.py exists and allows interaction with an agent according to docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md
   Context: docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md, scripts/run_local_agent.py
   Output: scripts/run_local_agent.py

## Execution Steps
- Artifacts are already present and marked complete. Ongoing maintenance of these artifacts should follow the specs referenced above.

## Administrative Steps
- This plan consolidates the former Task 7 (Agent Orchestrator) into Task 6.
