# Plan for Task 10: Tasks 6 & 7 should be joined into one

## Intent
Merge the responsibilities and artifacts of tasks 6 and 7 under a single task (task 6), consolidating plans and tests accordingly.

## Context
- Specs: docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md, docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Source files: tasks/TASKS.md, tasks/6/plan_6.md, tasks/7/plan_7.md

## Features
10.1) - Merge plans and specs under task 6
   Action: Inspect plans for tasks 6 and 7, unify their features and documentation under task 6; remove task 7 artifacts accordingly.
   Acceptance:
   - Only a single task (6) exists relating to the Agent; task 7 removed upon completion
   - All files, plans, and tests are under task 6
   - All features still present and working; all tests pass
   Dependencies: 9.1

10.2) - Merge tests
   Action: Inspect and consolidate tests from both tasks under task 6, ensuring coverage.
   Acceptance:
   - Tests for the unified task 6 pass
   Dependencies: 10.1, 9.1

## Execution Steps
- Perform 10.1 then 10.2; run tests and submit when green.
