  "action": "Create 4 personas that will serve different purposes:\n   - Manager: An agent that looks at the task description and identifies any missing specification or context. They must identify all necessary information to be in place for the other agents to proceed with their work. They are responsible for seeing if the work has been done, or whether it couldn't due to bad/missing spec. This agent is the one that can edit the task description.\n   - Planner: An agent that looks at the task description and creates a plan for completing a task following the given specifications. This agent is the one that can edit the plan description.\n   - Tester: An agent that looks at the task description, and then for each feature creates the most appropriate acceptance criteria. Based on that criteria the agent creates a test case for each feature. This agent is the one that can edit the tests.\n   - Developer: An agent that looks at the task description, and for each feature, looks at the acceptance criteria, and develops the necesary result that satisfies the acceptance criteria.",

    "Four personas exist that describe the roles of the agents. These personas are detailed in a file `docs/AGENT_PERSONAS.md`. A script exists that allows running these personas, so that for each task, the persona script can run and see if there's anything else for it to do. Once these personas are implemented, this task should be updated accordingly so that it follows spec. Each persona has a prompt that is clearly visible. `run_local_agent.py` is updated with the workflow that these new personas introduce. I must be able to run the personas individually once this task is completed to check each agent."
