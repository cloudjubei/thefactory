# Plan for Task 15: Running specific tasks and features

## Intent
Allow running the orchestrator targeting a specific task (-t) and optionally a feature (-f), and ensure correct branch naming.

## Context
- Specs: scripts/run_local_agent.py, tasks/TASKS.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md

## Features
15.1) - Implement targeted execution flags and branching
   Action: Add CLI flags -t {task_id} and -f {feature_id} to the orchestrator and implement branch naming conventions.
   Acceptance:
   - Agent executes the specified task or feature and outputs the result
   - Branch naming: features/{task_id}_{feature_id} or tasks/{task_id}
   Context: scripts/run_local_agent.py, tasks/TASKS.md
   Output: Updated scripts/run_local_agent.py behavior and documentation
   Notes: Validate inputs and ensure compatibility with existing flow.

## Execution Steps
1) Extend orchestrator CLI and behavior
2) Update related docs if needed
3) Submit for review
4) Finish
