# Plan for Task 1: Task format

## Intent
Provide a formal, specification-driven task format and ensure the canonical task list adheres to it. This plan documents how Task 1 was and remains satisfied in alignment with current specifications.

## Context
- Specs: docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Source files: tasks/TASKS.md

## Features
1.1) - Create Task Format specification
   Action: Author docs/TASK_FORMAT.md defining task fields, statuses, rules (Sequential Knowledge, Non-Redundancy), examples, and tips.
   Acceptance:
   - docs/TASK_FORMAT.md exists
   - The document includes Field Definitions, Statuses, Rules, Examples, and Tips
   - The format is unambiguous and self-contained
   Context: docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md (structure expectations), docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md (complementary patterns)
   Output: docs/TASK_FORMAT.md
   Rejection: docs/TASK_FORMAT.md is missing required terms/sections: Statuses

1.2) + Apply format to TASKS
   Action: Update tasks/TASKS.md to follow docs/TASK_FORMAT.md and reference it at the top for readers.
   Acceptance:
   - All tasks follow the required structure and status codes
   - The top of tasks/TASKS.md references docs/TASK_FORMAT.md
   - Content is consistent and readable as a reproducible log
   Context: tasks/TASKS.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md
   Output: Updated tasks/TASKS.md
   Dependencies: 1.1

## Execution Steps
For each feature in order:
1) Gather the Minimum Cohesive Context using retrieve_context_files (TASKS.md, plan file, and relevant specs)
2) Implement the change(s) with write_file according to the specs
3) If tests are applicable for future revisions of this task, add tests under tasks/1/tests/ and run run_tests
4) Call finish_feature to create a per-feature commit when features are modified in the future

After all features are completed or unchanged:
5) Run run_tests (if tests exist) and ensure the suite passes
6) Update tasks/TASKS.md if the task status needs change
7) Submit for review
8) Finish

## Notes
- Features 1.1 and 1.2 are already completed and remain stable; this plan update brings the plan file in line with current specifications without altering task status.
