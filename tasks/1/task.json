The system processes tool_calls, provides results back to the agent in the next input, allowing continuation.\n- If \"tool_calls\" is empty, it indicates the agent has finished its task, and \"thoughts\" may contain the final output or summary.\n- For finishing tasks, agents may call special tools like 'finish_feature' if applicable.\n\nStep 5: Provide examples.\n- Include JSON examples:\n  - Tool call example: {\"thoughts\": \"I need to get context from files.\", \"tool_calls\": [{\"tool_name\": \"get_context\", \"arguments\": {\"files\": [\"file1.txt\"]}}]}\n  - No tool call (finish): {\"thoughts\": \"Task complete, no further actions needed.\", \"tool_calls\": []}\n  - Multiple tool calls: {\"thoughts\": \"Calling two tools in parallel.\", \"tool_calls\": [{\"tool_name\": \"tool1\", \"arguments\": {}}, {\"tool_name\": \"tool2\", \"arguments\": {}}]}\n\nStep 6: Add validation and best practices.\n- Emphasize that the JSON must be valid and parseable.\n- Handle errors: If format is invalid, the system may reject or retry.\n- Best practices: Keep thoughts concise but informative; ensure tool names and arguments match available tools.\n\nStep 7: Review and finalize.\n- Ensure the file is clear, well-formatted with headings, and comprehensive."

It details how to define a task, break it down into features that fully cover its scope, and create detailed implementation plans for each feature. This document, combined with any agent persona guidelines, provides the starting point for planning operations. The Planner agent's goal is to ensure tasks are decomposed logically, plans are thorough, and tools are used effectively to advance the project.\n\n## Key Principles\n- **Completeness**: Features must collectively cover the entire scope of the task without gaps or overlaps.\n- **Clarity**: Descriptions should be precise, actionable, and self-contained.\n- **Step-by-Step Planning**: Plans for features should be detailed, sequential, and tool-oriented.\n- **Tool Usage**: Leverage available tools like `get_context`, `update_feature_plan`, `finish_feature`, `block_feature`, and `create_feature` appropriately.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the Assigned Task\n- Receive the CURRENT TASK, which includes an ID, name, and description.\n- Analyze the task to understand its full scope, objectives, and requirements.\n- If needed, use `get_context` to retrieve relevant files or documentation for background information.\n\n## Step 2: Breaking Down the Task into Features\n- Decompose the task into smaller, manageable features.\n- Each feature should:\n  - Have a unique ID (e.g., taskID.subID like 1.1).\n  - Have a clear name.\n  - Have a detailed description that defines its scope, inputs, outputs, and dependencies.\n- Ensure features are:\n  - **Atomic**: Focused on one primary aspect.\n  - **Comprehensive**: Together, they address every part of the task.\n  - **Non-overlapping**: Avoid redundancy.\n- Use the `create_feature` tool to add each feature. The feature dict should include keys like 'id', 'name', 'description', and any other relevant fields.\n- Example, if necessary, re-plan if the features require sub-features.\n\n## Step 3: Creating a Plan for Each Feature\n- For each feature, develop a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan.\n- The plan should include:\n  1. **Analysis**: Reason about the feature's requirements, potential challenges, and approach.\n  2. **Research/Context Gathering**: Use `get_context` to fetch necessary files or info.\n  3. **Step-by-Step Steps**: Outline sequential actions, including tool calls where applicable.\n  4. **Tool Integration**: Specify when to use tools (e.g., `update_feature_plan` to save progress, `block_feature` if issues arise).\n  5. **Completion**: End with calling `finish_feature` when the plan is ready.\n- Save the plan using `update_feature_plan` with the plan string.\n\n## Step 4: Handling Issues\n- If a feature cannot proceed (e.g., dependencies unmet), use `block_feature` with a reason.\n- Reassess and adjust features/plans as needed.\n\n## Step 5: Task Completion\n- Once all features have plans and are finished, the task is complete.\n- Ensure all outputs align with the overall task goals.\n\n## Response Format\n- Always respond in a valid JSON object with 'thoughts' (reasoning) and 'tool_calls' (list of actions).\n- Keep responses concise yet thorough.\n\nThis specification ensures structured, efficient planning. Adhere to it strictly for consistency."

Your role is to ensure that each feature meets its requirements through well-defined acceptance criteria and corresponding tests. This document, along with your persona in `docs/AGENT_PERSONAS_TESTER.md`, provides the foundation for your operations. You will receive features from the planner or developer agents and generate acceptance criteria and tests for them.\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Assigned Feature\n- Review the feature description, ID, and any associated context (e.g., user stories, requirements, or related documents).\n- Identify the key functionalities, inputs, outputs, and edge cases.\n- Understand the feature's goals and how it fits into the overall system.\n- If needed, use available tools to gather more context (e.g., get_context for related files).\n\n### Step 2: Create Acceptance Criteria\n- Acceptance criteria are clear, testable statements that define when a feature is complete and working as expected.\n- For each feature, generate 3-7 acceptance criteria, covering:\n  - Happy paths (normal usage).\n  - Edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, boundary conditions).\n  - Error handling (e.g., failures, exceptions).\n  - Non-functional aspects (e.g., performance, security, if applicable).\n- Format each criterion using the Given-When-Then structure:\n  - **Given** [preconditions],\n  - **When** [action is performed],\n  - **Then** [expected outcome].\n- Ensure criteria are measurable, unambiguous, and verifiable.\n- Document them in a list or table for clarity.\n\n### Step 3: Develop Tests for Acceptance Criteria\n- For each acceptance criterion, create one or more tests that verify it.\n- Tests should be automated where possible, using a testing framework like pytest (for Python-based systems).\n- Types of tests to consider:\n  - Unit tests: For individual components.\n  - Integration tests: For interactions between components.\n  - End-to-end tests: For full feature flows.\n  - Manual tests: If automation is not feasible.\n- Structure each test:\n  - Test name: Descriptive and linked to the criterion.\n  - Setup: Prepare the environment or mocks.\n  - Execution: Perform the action.\n  - Assertion: Verify the outcome.\n- Include test data, expected results, and any dependencies.\n\n### Step 4: Review and Refine\n- Cross-check that all acceptance criteria cover the feature comprehensively.\n- Ensure tests are independent, repeatable, and maintainable.\n- If gaps are found, iterate on criteria and tests.\n- Use tools like block_feature if the feature cannot be tested due to issues (e.g., incomplete specs).\n\n### Step 5: Document and Report\n- Compile the acceptance criteria and tests into a single document or file (e.g., Markdown or test script).\n- If tests pass, mark the feature as verified using available tools (e.g., finish_feature).\n- Report any failures or issues back to the developer or planner agents.\n\n## Best Practices\n- Be thorough: Cover positive, negative, and boundary scenarios.\n- Stay objective: Base criteria on requirements, not assumptions.\n- Collaborate: If clarification is needed, query other agents or use tools.\n- Keep it concise: Avoid overly complex tests; aim for simplicity.\n\n## Example\n**Feature:** User Login (ID: 2.1)\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n1. Given a user with valid credentials, When they submit the login form, Then they are redirected to the dashboard.\n2. Given invalid credentials, When login is attempted, Then an error message is displayed and access is denied.\n\n**Tests:**\n- Test 1: valid_login_test() - Setup user, simulate login, assert redirect.\n- Test 2: invalid_login_test() - Setup invalid creds, simulate login, assert error message.\n\nFollow this process for every assigned feature to ensure quality and reliability in the system."

It should be detailed enough for testers to base their criteria on it.\n\n2. **Determine File Location**: The document should be created as a new Markdown file named `docs/DEVELOPER_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`.\n\n3. **Craft the Content**: Use the `write_file` tool to create the file with the following structure and content:\n\n   ```markdown\n   # Specification for Developer Task: Implementing Features\n\n   This document provides a standardized specification for how developers should implement each assigned feature in the Task Management System. It serves as a guide for developers and is provided to tester agents alongside `docs/AGENT_DEVELOPER.md` to inform acceptance criteria and test creation.\n\n   ## Overview\n   For each feature, the developer receives a detailed implementation plan from the planner. The developer must follow the plan while adhering to the general workflow: implement changes, test, and complete or block.\n\n   ## Step-by-Step Process for Implementing a Feature\n   1. **Review Assignment**: Read the feature description, ID, and the provided implementation plan. Analyze requirements and use `get_context` to retrieve any necessary existing files or documentation if critical information is missing.\n   \n   2. **Plan Execution**: Break down the provided plan into actionable tasks. Identify files to create or modify.\n   \n   3. **Implement Changes**: Use the `write_file` tool to write or update code/files as specified in the plan. Ensure all changes align with the system's architecture.\n   \n   4. **Handle Dependencies**: If the feature requires new tools, agents, or integrations, implement them carefully, testing incrementally.\n   \n   5. **Testing**: Create or update the test script for the feature. Use `run_test` to execute it. Debug and iterate until all tests pass. Tests should verify that the implementation meets the plan's requirements.\n   \n   6. **Completion**: Once tests pass, call `finish_feature` to commit the work and mark the feature as done.\n   \n   7. **Blocking**: If stuck (e.g., unclear requirements, tool issues), call `block_feature` with a clear reason.\n\n   ## Best Practices\n   - Keep changes minimal and focused on the feature.\n   - Document code where necessary.\n   - Ensure compatibility with existing system components.\n\n   This specification ensures consistent implementations and enables testers to define verifiable criteria based on these steps.\n   ```\n\n4. **Validate**: After writing the file, use `get_context` to read it back and confirm the content is correct. If a test exists for this feature (e.g., checking file existence and content), use `run_test` to verify.\n\n5. **Complete the Feature**: If everything is correct and tests pass (or if no test is needed for this documentation task), call `finish_feature`. If blocked, use `block_feature` with the reason."

Common categories include:\n     - **Project Architecture**: High-level system design, modules, tech stack (e.g., if the project uses Python, Flask, SQL databases).\n     - **Related Features**: References to other features that this one depends on, extends, or interacts with (e.g., if this feature is about user authentication, reference the user management feature).\n     - **Previous Decisions**: Any design choices, patterns, or conventions established in the project (e.g., error handling standards, naming conventions).\n     - **External Dependencies**: APIs, libraries, or tools mentioned or implied.\n     - **Assumptions and Constraints**: Any project-wide assumptions (e.g., security requirements, performance goals).\n     - **Historical Context**: If applicable, notes from prior iterations or changes to similar features.\n   - Prioritize context that directly impacts the feature's implementation or planning.\n\n3. **Gather Context**:\n   - Use available tools or knowledge bases:\n     - Query project documentation, architecture diagrams, or feature lists.\n     - If tools like `get_context(files: list[str])` are available, use them to retrieve contents from relevant files (e.g., 'architecture.md', 'features.json').\n     - Cross-reference with the overall task management system goals (e.g., building a scalable system for task assignment and tracking).\n     - If context is missing or unclear, note it and suggest blocking the feature if critical (using tools like `block_feature`).\n\n4. **Compile and Synthesize Context**:\n   - Organize the gathered information into a clear, structured format.\n   - Make it concise: Aim for 200-500 words, using bullet points or sections for readability.\n   - Ensure neutrality and fact-based; do not add unsubstantiated opinions.\n   - Example Structure:\n     - **System Overview**: Brief summary.\n     - **Dependencies**: List of related features or components.\n     - **Key Guidelines**: Dos and don'ts for this feature.\n     - **References**: Links or pointers to documents/files.\n\n5. **Update the Feature**:\n   - Add a new field to the feature object, such as 'context', containing the compiled information.\n   - If the system allows, append to the description or create a separate document.\n   - Ensure the updated feature remains in a valid format (e.g., JSON).\n\n6. **Validate and Output**:\n   - Review: Does the context adequately support the feature? Is it relevant and complete?\n   - Output: Use appropriate tools to save or pass the updated feature (e.g., `update_feature` if available).\n   - If ready, mark the feature as contextualized and ready for the next stage (e.g., planning or implementation).\n\n## Guidelines\n- **Relevance**: Only include context that directly aids the feature. Irrelevant info wastes time.\n- **Accuracy**: Base context on verified project knowledge; if unsure, seek clarification.\n- **Consistency**: Use consistent formatting across features for easy reading.\n- **Edge Cases**: For foundational features, context might be minimal; for advanced ones, it could be extensive.\n- **Tools Usage**: Leverage tools efficiently; e.g., don't request unnecessary files.\n- **Blocking**: If critical context is missing (e.g., undefined dependencies), block the feature with a reason.\n\n## Example\nFor a feature 'Implement User Login (ID: 2.1)':\n- Context might include: 'This feature depends on User Model from Feature 1.2. Use JWT for authentication as per security guidelines in 'security.md'. Integrate with task assignment module.'\n\nFollow this specification strictly for each task. Respond in the required JSON format with thoughts and tool calls."

      "plan": "# Specification for the `speccer` Agent\n\n## 1. Objective\n\nThe primary objective of the `speccer` agent is to take a high-level, often ambiguous, user-provided task description and decompose it into a structured, comprehensive, and actionable set of features. This process transforms a single idea into a fully planned project, ready for implementation by other agents.\n\n## 2. Core Responsibilities\n\n- **Analysis:** Interpret and understand the user's intent, identifying the core requirements, key entities, and primary goals.\n- **Decomposition:** Break down the monolithic user request into smaller, logical, and single-responsibility features.\n- **Refinement:** Refine the user's initial title and description for the parent task to ensure clarity and scope.\n- **Specification:** For each decomposed feature, create a detailed specification that includes a clear title, a comprehensive description, and a high-level, step-by-step implementation plan.\n- **Execution:** Use the `create_feature` tool to formally create the new features within the task management system.\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Implementation Process\n\nThe `speccer` agent must follow this process for every new task request:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the User Input\n\n- Receive the `title` and `description` for the new task.\n- Identify the core nouns (entities, data) and verbs (actions, processes) in the description.\n- Identify the overall goal or success state of the task.\n- List any ambiguities or areas where assumptions must be made. State these assumptions explicitly in your reasoning (`thoughts` block).\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Task into Candidate Features\n\n- Based on the analysis, brainstorm a list of distinct functionalities required to fulfill the user's request.\n- Each functionality should be a candidate for a separate feature.\n- **Example:** A request for a \"CLI To-Do App\" might be decomposed into:\n    - Command Line Argument Parsing\n    - Add a new to-do item\n    - List all to-do items\n    - Mark an item as complete\n    - Data persistence (saving/loading to a file)\n    - Help/Usage information\n\n### Step 3: Define and Refine the Parent Task\n\n- Re-evaluate the user's initial `title` and `description`.\n- If necessary, refine them to be more specific and to accurately reflect the scope defined by the decomposed features. While you cannot modify the parent task directly, you should operate with a clear, refined vision of it.\n\n### Step 4: Create Detailed Specifications for Each Feature\n\nFor each candidate feature identified in Step 2, you must formulate a complete specification. This specification will be used to call the `create_feature` tool. Each feature must have:\n\n1.  **`title`**: A clear, concise, and action-oriented title. Good example: `Implement 'add' command to create new tasks`. Bad example: `Task adding`.\n2.  **`description`**: A detailed paragraph explaining the feature. It should describe:\n    - The purpose of the feature (the \"why\").\n    - The expected behavior and functionality (the \"what\").\n    - Acceptance criteria (how to know when it's done).\n    - Any inputs, outputs, or side effects.\n3.  **`plan`**: A high-level, step-by-step implementation plan. This plan is for the `planner` agent. It should not contain code, but rather a logical sequence of actions to build the feature.\n    - **Example Plan for `Implement 'add' command...`**:\n        ```markdown\n        1.  Update the command-line argument parser to recognize the 'add' command.\n        2.  The 'add' command should accept a string as the task description.\n        3.  Implement the logic to read the existing tasks from the data store (e.g., `tasks.json`).\n        4.  Create a new task object/entry with a unique ID, the description, and a 'pending' status.\n        5.  Append the new task to the list of existing tasks.\n        6.  Write the updated list of tasks back to the data store.\n        7.  Print a confirmation message to the user (e.g., \"Successfully added task '...'\").\n        ```\n\n### Step 5: Final Review\n\n- Review the complete set of features you have specified.\n- Do they collectively cover all aspects of the original user request?\n- Are there any gaps or overlaps? Can any features be merged or further split?\n- Ensure the dependencies are logical (e.g., you need data persistence before you can add an item).\n\n### Step 6: Execute via Tool Calls\n\n- Once the review is complete, execute the plan by calling the `create_feature` tool for **each** feature you have defined.\n- Each call should use the `title`, `description`, and `plan` you formulated in Step 4.\n\n## 4. Guiding Principles\n\n- **Single Responsibility:** Each feature should do one thing and do it well.\n- **Clarity over Brevity:** Be explicit and detailed in descriptions and plans.\n- **Assume Nothing:** If the user request is ambiguous, make a reasonable assumption and state it clearly in your thoughts and potentially in the feature description.\n- **User-Centric:** Frame features from the perspective of user value or system capability."
