# Plan for Task 2: The spec

## Intent
Ensure Task 2 satisfies its Acceptance by providing a concise, specification-driven plan that documents features producing docs/SPEC.md as the project's single entry-point, with explicit per-output test features per PLAN_SPECIFICATION.

## Context
- Specs: docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/TESTING.md, docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
- Supporting: tasks/TASKS.md
- Source/Output: docs/SPEC.md (entry point), docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md, docs/TEMPLATE.md

## Features
2.1) + Create the specification guide
   Action: Provide a comprehensive guide to writing specifications.
   Acceptance: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md exists and covers Problem Statement, Inputs and Outputs, Constraints, Success Criteria, Edge Cases, Examples.
   Context: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   Output: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md

2.2) + Provide a template with examples
   Action: Create a template with all required sections and example content per the guide.
   Acceptance: docs/TEMPLATE.md exists with placeholders and example snippets for all sections required by docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md.
   Context: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   Output: docs/TEMPLATE.md

2.3) + Create the spec
   Action: Create docs/SPEC.md that serves as the project's entry point.
   Acceptance:
   - docs/SPEC.md exists
   - The document includes sections: WHAT, CORE IDEAS, ACTIONS
   - The document references SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md at the top
   Context: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md
   Output: docs/SPEC.md

2.4) + Tests: SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md required sections
   Action: Add a deterministic test verifying that docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md exists and includes all required section headings.
   Acceptance:
   - tasks/2/tests/test_2_4.py exists
   - The test checks for presence of headings: "Problem Statement", "Inputs and Outputs", "Constraints", "Success Criteria", "Edge Cases", "Examples"
   - run_tests passes and reports PASS for this test
   Context: docs/TESTING.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   Dependencies: 2.1
   Output: tasks/2/tests/test_2_4.py

2.5) + Tests: TEMPLATE.md coverage
   Action: Add a deterministic test verifying docs/TEMPLATE.md exists and includes placeholders/headers for all sections defined by the guide.
   Acceptance:
   - tasks/2/tests/test_2_5.py exists
   - The test checks for presence of section headers/markers (e.g., "# Problem Statement", "# Inputs and Outputs", "# Constraints", "# Success Criteria", "# Edge Cases", "# Examples")
   - run_tests passes and reports PASS for this test
   Context: docs/TESTING.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   Dependencies: 2.2
   Output: tasks/2/tests/test_2_5.py

2.6) + Tests: SPEC.md structure and reference
   Action: Add a deterministic test verifying docs/SPEC.md exists and matches required structure and references the guide.
   Acceptance:
   - tasks/2/tests/test_2_6.py exists
   - The test asserts docs/SPEC.md includes headings "WHAT", "CORE IDEAS", "ACTIONS" and a visible reference string to "SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md" near the top
   - run_tests passes and reports PASS for this test
   Context: docs/TESTING.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md, docs/SPEC.md
   Dependencies: 2.3
   Output: tasks/2/tests/test_2_6.py

## Execution Steps
For each pending feature in order (2.4â€“2.6):
1) Gather MCC using retrieve_context_files for the feature's referenced specs and files
2) Implement the feature changes
3) Create the test(s) under tasks/2/tests/ that verify the feature's acceptance criteria
4) Run tests using run_tests and ensure tests pass
5) Call finish_feature with a descriptive message once acceptance criteria are met

After all features are completed:
6) Run run_tests again to ensure the full suite passes
7) Update tasks/TASKS.md if the status for Task 2 changes
8) Submit for review (open PR)
9) Finish
