# Plan for Task 2: The spec

## Intent
Ensure Task 2 is satisfied by maintaining a concise, specification-driven plan that documents the feature(s) producing docs/SPEC.md as the project's entry point. The plan adheres to PLAN_SPECIFICATION and FEATURE_FORMAT.

## Context
- Specs: docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
- Supporting: tasks/TASKS.md
- Source/Output: docs/SPEC.md (output of this task); verify and maintain as single entry-point

## Features
2.1) + Create the spec
   Action: Author docs/SPEC.md that serves as the project's entry point. It must define WHAT, CORE IDEAS, and ACTIONS, and include a top reference to SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md.
   Acceptance:
   - docs/SPEC.md exists
   - The document includes sections: WHAT, CORE IDEAS, ACTIONS
   - The document references SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md at the top
   Context: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/SPEC.md
   Dependencies: None
   Output: docs/SPEC.md

## Execution Steps
For each feature in order:
1) Gather MCC via retrieve_context_files for the feature's referenced specs and any existing files
2) Implement/refine the feature changes (create or update docs/SPEC.md) to meet acceptance
3) If this task requires tests, create them under tasks/2/tests/ and run with run_tests; otherwise defer legacy test coverage to the general testing tasks
4) Call finish_feature with a descriptive message once acceptance criteria are met

After all features are completed:
5) Run run_tests again to ensure full suite passes (if tests exist)
6) Update tasks/TASKS.md if the status changes
7) Submit for review (open PR)
8) Finish
