# Plan for Task 2: The spec

## Intent
Align Task 2's plan with current PLAN_SPECIFICATION and FEATURE_FORMAT. Preserve completed deliverables and add explicit test features to satisfy Test-Driven Acceptance for artifacts: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md, docs/TEMPLATE.md, and docs/SPEC.md.

## Context
- Specs: docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/TESTING.md
- Source/Output: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md, docs/TEMPLATE.md, docs/SPEC.md
- Supporting: tasks/TASKS.md

## Features
2.1) + Create the specification guide
   Action: Provide a comprehensive guide to writing specifications.
   Acceptance: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md exists and covers Problem Statement, Inputs and Outputs, Constraints, Success Criteria, Edge Cases, Examples.
   Context: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   Output: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md

2.2) + Provide a template with examples
   Action: Create a template with all required sections and example content per the guide.
   Acceptance: docs/TEMPLATE.md exists with placeholders and example snippets for all sections required by docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md.
   Context: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   Dependencies: 4.1
   Output: docs/TEMPLATE.md

2.3) + Create the spec
   Action: Create docs/SPEC.md that serves as the project's entry point.
   Acceptance:
   - docs/SPEC.md exists
   - The document includes sections: WHAT, CORE IDEAS, ACTIONS
   - The document references SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md at the top
   Context: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/SPEC.md
   Dependencies: 4.1
   Output: docs/SPEC.md

2.4) - Write tests for SPECIFICATION_GUIDE completeness (2.1)
   Action: Author an acceptance test that validates docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md includes all required sections.
   Acceptance:
   - tasks/2/tests/test_2_4.py exists
   - The test verifies docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md contains headings/sections: "Problem Statement", "Inputs and Outputs", "Constraints", "Success Criteria", "Edge Cases", "Examples"
   - Running the test via run_tests returns PASS for this check
   Context: docs/TESTING.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   Dependencies: 2.1
   Output: tasks/2/tests/test_2_4.py
   Notes: Use deterministic string checks per docs/TESTING.md.

2.5) - Write tests for TEMPLATE coverage (2.2)
   Action: Author an acceptance test that validates docs/TEMPLATE.md contains placeholders and example snippets for all sections required by the guide.
   Acceptance:
   - tasks/2/tests/test_2_5.py exists
   - The test verifies docs/TEMPLATE.md includes the following section anchors/placeholders: "Problem Statement", "Inputs and Outputs", "Constraints", "Success Criteria", "Edge Cases", "Examples"
   - run_tests passes for this test
   Context: docs/TESTING.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md, docs/TEMPLATE.md
   Dependencies: 2.2
   Output: tasks/2/tests/test_2_5.py

2.6) - Write tests for SPEC entry point (2.3)
   Action: Author an acceptance test that validates docs/SPEC.md has the entry-point sections and references the guide at the top.
   Acceptance:
   - tasks/2/tests/test_2_6.py exists
   - The test verifies docs/SPEC.md exists and contains headings: "WHAT", "CORE IDEAS", "ACTIONS"
   - The test verifies docs/SPEC.md references "SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md" near the top (presence of the filename string is sufficient)
   - run_tests passes for this test
   Context: docs/TESTING.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/SPEC.md, docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
   Dependencies: 2.3
   Output: tasks/2/tests/test_2_6.py

## Execution Steps
For each feature in order:
1) Gather MCC via retrieve_context_files for the feature's referenced specs and any existing files
2) Implement or refine the feature changes (for test features: add tests under tasks/2/tests/)
3) Run tests using run_tests and ensure tests pass
4) Call finish_feature with a descriptive message (e.g., "Feature 2.{n} complete: {Title}")

After all features are completed:
5) Run run_tests again and ensure the full suite passes
6) Update tasks/TASKS.md with status change for this task if applicable
7) Submit for review (open PR)
8) Finish
