# Plan for Task 2: The spec

## Intent
Satisfy Task 2 acceptance by ensuring a clear entry-point specification exists. The plan documents the feature(s) that produce `docs/SPEC.md` with sections WHAT, CORE IDEAS, and ACTIONS, and references `SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md`.

## Context
- Specs: docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md
- Source files: docs/SPEC.md (output of this task)

## Features
2.1) + Create the spec
   Action: Author `docs/SPEC.md` that serves as the project's entry point. It must define WHAT, CORE IDEAS, and ACTIONS, and include a top reference to `SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md`.
   Acceptance:
   - `docs/SPEC.md` exists
   - The document includes sections: WHAT, CORE IDEAS, ACTIONS
   - The document references `SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md` at the top
   Context: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md
   Output: docs/SPEC.md
   Notes: This task predated the mandatory per-feature test protocol; automated tests for legacy tasks are addressed under Task 9.

## Execution Steps
For each feature in order:
1) Gather MCC via `retrieve_context_files` for the feature's referenced specs and any existing files
2) Implement the feature changes (create or refine `docs/SPEC.md`)
3) If this task requires tests, create them under `tasks/2/tests/` and run with `run_tests`; otherwise defer legacy test coverage to Task 9
4) Call `finish_feature` with a descriptive message once acceptance criteria are met

After all features are completed:
5) Run `run_tests` again to ensure full suite passes (if tests exist)
6) Update `tasks/TASKS.md` if status changed
7) Submit for review (open PR)
8) Finish
