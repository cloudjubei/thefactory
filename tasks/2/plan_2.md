# Plan for Task 2: The spec

## Intent
Provide the entry-point specification that guides contributors and agents on how to begin work on the project.

## Context
- Specs: docs/SPEC.md, docs/TASK_FORMAT.md, docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md, docs/TESTING.md
- Source files: tasks/TASKS.md

## Features
2.1) + Create the project SPEC entry document
   Action: Author docs/SPEC.md as the main entry-point specification.
   Acceptance:
   - docs/SPEC.md exists and describes WHAT, CORE IDEAS, and ACTIONS
   Output: docs/SPEC.md

2.2) / Write tests for SPEC
   Action: Add a test under tasks/2/tests/ that validates docs/SPEC.md exists and contains the key sections.
   Acceptance:
   - Test asserts existence and required headings
   Dependencies: 9.1
   Notes: Legacy task; tests to be implemented under Task 9.

## Execution Steps
- Backfilled: No further changes required; tests deferred to Task 9.
