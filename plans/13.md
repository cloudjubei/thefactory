Plan:
1. Read `TASKS.md` to get the list of all tasks.
2. Create the `plans/` directory.
3. For each task ID, create a corresponding markdown file (e.g., `plans/1.md`).
4. Write a brief, logical plan for how to accomplish each task, based on its description and acceptance criteria.
5. After creating all plan files, update `TASKS.md` to mark this task as complete.
