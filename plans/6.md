Plan:
1. Create the `AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md` file.
2. Define the key terms "Agent" and "Orchestrator" to establish a clear vocabulary.
3. Outline the core principles: Specification-Driven, LLM-Led Intelligence, and Interactive Decision Points. This establishes the high-level philosophy of the agent's operation.
