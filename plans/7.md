Plan:
1. Create the `TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md` file.
2. Specify the JSON contract for communication between the Orchestrator and the Agent.
3. Define the complete suite of available tools (`write_file`, `submit_for_review`, `ask_question`, `finish`).
4. Describe the arguments and expected behavior for each tool.
5. Define safety and execution modes.
6. This specification will supersede any prior architectural ideas.
