Plan:
1. Create a new file named `TASKS.md`.
2. Define the initial set of tasks required to bootstrap the project.
3. Ensure there is at least one pending task to give the agent a starting point.
4. Include tasks for creating the core specification documents (`SPEC.md`, `SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md`, `TASK_FORMAT.md`).
