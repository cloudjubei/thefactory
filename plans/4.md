Plan:
1. Create a new file named `TASK_FORMAT.md`.
2. Define the structure of a task: ID, Status, Title, Action, Acceptance, Dependencies, Output.
3. Explain each field clearly.
4. Introduce key principles for task management: Sequential Knowledge and Non-Redundancy.
5. Provide examples of good tasks.
6. Ensure `TASKS.md` adheres to the defined format.
