Plan:
1. Create the `scripts/run_local_agent.py` file.
2. Implement the main loop that:
   a. Gathers context from the project files.
   b. Sends the context and a prompt to the Agent (LLM).
   c. Receives the JSON response from the Agent.
   d. Parses the response and executes the specified tool calls.
3. Ensure the implementation strictly follows the contracts in `TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md` and principles in `AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md`.
