Plan:
1. Create the `PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md` file.
2. Define the purpose of a task plan: to outline the steps an agent will take to complete a task *before* execution.
3. Specify that each task in `TASKS.md` should have a corresponding plan file in a `/plans` directory.
4. The plan should be a simple, human-readable list of actions.
