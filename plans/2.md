Plan:
1. Create a new file named `SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md`.
2. Document the core components of a good specification: Problem Statement, Inputs/Outputs, Constraints, Success Criteria, Edge Cases.
3. Provide a clear "Good vs. Bad" example to illustrate the principles.
4. Include the "Self-Cleaning Principle" to guide future specification evolution.
5. Ensure `SPEC.md` adheres to the created guide.
