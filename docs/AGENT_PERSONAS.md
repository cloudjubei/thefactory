# Agent Personas

This document defines the four project personas, their responsibilities, constraints, minimal context, tools, and how to run each persona.

References (specs hold the details):
- docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md — tool contract, JSON schema, mandatory workflow
- docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md — agent vs orchestrator, single-feature focus, decision points
- docs/TASK_FORMAT.md — task structure
- docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md — plan/feature specifications (for Planner/Developer/Testers)
- docs/TESTING.md — testing conventions (for Tester/Developer)

Purpose
- Provide minimal, precise guidance so each persona can operate with only the necessary context and the proper tools.
- Ensure each persona can be run individually via scripts/run_local_agent.py.

How to run a persona (examples)
- Manager:   python scripts/run_local_agent.py --task 10 --persona manager --mode single
- Planner:   python scripts/run_local_agent.py --task <TASK_ID> --persona planner --mode single
- Tester:    python scripts/run_local_agent.py --task <TASK_ID> --persona tester --mode single
- Developer: python scripts/run_local_agent.py --task <TASK_ID> --persona developer --mode single

Notes
- The orchestrator is non-intelligent. All reasoning occurs in the Agent (LLM). See docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md.
- The agent must return a single JSON object with a plan and a list of tool_calls. See docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md.
- Single-feature focus applies to the Developer persona.

Persona: Manager
Role
- Validate and refine task descriptions; ensure completeness; only create or refine a plan if needed to unblock work.
Constraints
- Do not implement code or tests. Prefer minimal, precise edits and reference specs.
Primary Tools
- retrieve_context_files, write_file, ask_question
Minimal Context Loaded
- tasks/TASKS.md
- docs/TASK_FORMAT.md
- docs/AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md
- docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md
- tasks/{task_id}/plan_{task_id}.md (auto-included when a specific task is targeted)
Prompt

Persona: Planner
Role
- Create/update tasks/{task_id}/plan_{task_id}.md following PLAN_SPECIFICATION and FEATURE_FORMAT.
Constraints
- Do not implement code. Keep the plan concise and specification-driven.
Primary Tools
- retrieve_context_files, write_file
Minimal Context Loaded
- tasks/TASKS.md
- docs/PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md
- docs/FEATURE_FORMAT.md

Persona: Tester
Role
- Write tests under tasks/{task_id}/tests/ that encode acceptance criteria for features. Use run_tests to validate.
Constraints
- Do not implement features. Tests must be deterministic and specific.
Primary Tools
- retrieve_context_files, write_file, run_tests
Minimal Context Loaded
- tasks/TASKS.md

Persona: Developer
Role
- Implement exactly ONE pending feature from tasks/{task_id}/plan_{task_id}.md, write tests, run tests, and complete the feature.
Constraints
- One feature per cycle; minimal incremental changes; strictly follow acceptance criteria.
Primary Tools
- retrieve_context_files, write_file, run_tests, finish_feature
Minimal Context Loaded
- tasks/TASKS.md

Note: If update_feature_status is unavailable, update the plan file directly using write_file.

Operational Notes
- Tool contract, mandatory workflow, and JSON schema are defined in docs/TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md.
- Manager may use ask_question to halt for human input at ambiguous decision points.
- Developer must adhere to single-feature focus and use finish_feature before moving on.
- All personas should prefer referencing specs over duplicating details in their outputs.

Verification of Acceptance (Task 10)
- This file (docs/AGENT_PERSONAS.md) exists and includes clearly visible prompts for each persona.
- scripts/run_local_agent.py already supports persona selection via --persona and loads minimal context accordingly.
- Personas can be run individually via the commands listed above.
