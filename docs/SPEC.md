# WHAT:
- Each project, this one included, can be split into two parts -> the specification and the implementation.
- The specification defines what the project does, so that anyone - be it an AI agent or a human can read it and implement the details.
- Thus the implementation is a solution to the specification.
- Given an adequate enough specification, it should be possible to achieve a replicable result no matter how someone implements it. This is akin to scientists defining experiments that can be verified by anyone else. 
- This is what Specification Programming (SP) is. It's the focus on the WHAT - the final result.
- To see how to write a proper specification with examples, reference **[SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md](SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md)**.

# CORE IDEAS:
- This project is a framework/factory/foundry that produces solutions to other problems.
- This project will write the best possible specification for a given problem so that other problems can be solved.
- This project is self-referential - it will keep on improving its own specification and its own methods, so that other projects will benefit.
- This project is programming language agnostic. It grows with its use cases and tries to find solutions specific to given problems. If a new better solution appears then it will execute on it.
- This project uses Git for source control.

# ACTIONS:
- Read **[PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md](PLAN_SPECIFICATION.md)** to follow the mandatory plan workflow.
- Read **[TASKS.md](../tasks/TASKS.md)**, work on the next possible pending/unknown task.
