# Project Specification

This document adheres to the repository's Specification Guide. See: docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md

## Problem Statement
The project provides a specification-driven workflow for AI agents to plan, implement, and test features using a tool-based architecture. We need a single entry-point specification that clearly communicates the problem scope and expected outcomes in a consistent structure.

## Inputs and Outputs
- Inputs:
  - Task descriptions under tasks/TASKS.md and per-task plans under tasks/{task_id}/plan_{task_id}.md
  - Repository specifications and guides under docs/
  - Tooling and orchestration scripts under scripts/
- Outputs:
  - Verified changes to repository files per feature
  - Deterministic tests under tasks/{task_id}/tests/
  - Per-feature commits and task-level submissions for review

## Constraints
- The agent must follow the tool contract and operate through structured JSON responses.
- One cycle must complete exactly one feature end-to-end.
- Tests must be deterministic, framework-free, and verify acceptance criteria.
- Documentation files must follow the formats defined in the repository guides.

## Success Criteria
- docs/SPEC.md follows the structure and intent of the Specification Guide.
- Required sections exist in the correct order with clear, concise content.
- Tests exist that verify the presence and order of required sections and a guide reference.
- The repository remains consistent with the tool-using agent architecture.

## Edge Cases
- Existing docs/SPEC.md content may have different headings or order; this document must normalize it.
- Additional headings beyond the required sections are allowed only after the core sections and must not supersede them.
- Minor variations in wording are acceptable if intent remains aligned with the guide.

## Examples
- A compliant specification starts with a short reference to the guide and presents the sections in the exact order:
  1) Problem Statement
  2) Inputs and Outputs
  3) Constraints
  4) Success Criteria
  5) Edge Cases
  6) Examples
- Tests assert existence, structure, and order of these sections and the presence of a guide reference near the top.
