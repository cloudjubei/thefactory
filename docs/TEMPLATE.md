# Specification Template

This template adheres to docs/SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md. Use it to draft clear, testable specifications.

# Problem Statement
Placeholder: Clearly describe the problem to be solved and the context in which it exists.
Example:
- Users cannot consistently run the agent because the configuration process is unclear.
- We need a documented, repeatable setup.

# Inputs and Outputs
Placeholder: Enumerate the inputs the system accepts and the outputs it must produce.
Example:
- Inputs: .env file with API keys; command-line flags; repository path.
- Outputs: Generated files; console logs; exit codes for tests.

# Constraints
Placeholder: List technical, operational, or environmental constraints.
Example:
- Must run with Python 3.11+.
- No external network calls during tests.
- Only use standard library in tests.

# Success Criteria
Placeholder: Define objective, verifiable criteria that indicate success.
Example:
- Required files exist at specified paths.
- Tests under tasks/{task_id}/tests/ pass with exit code 0.
- Document includes all required sections and phrases.

# Edge Cases
Placeholder: Identify unusual or problematic scenarios the spec must address.
Example:
- Missing environment variables.
- Repository paths with spaces.
- Conflicting task statuses.

# Examples
Placeholder: Provide concrete examples illustrating expected behavior or structure.
Example:
- A minimal test script that checks file existence and key headings.
- A directory layout showing where new files are created.
