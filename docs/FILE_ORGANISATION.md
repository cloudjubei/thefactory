# File Organisation

This document outlines the standard file and directory structure for the project. A consistent structure is essential for maintaining clarity, scalability, and ease of navigation as the project grows.

## Guiding Principles

- **Clarity over Brevity**: Directory and file names should be descriptive and unambiguous.
- **Logical Grouping**: Related files should be grouped together by function or type.
- **Scalability**: The structure should accommodate future growth without requiring major refactoring.

## Top-Level Directory Structure

```
.
├── .github/         # CI/CD workflows and issue templates
├── docs/            # All specification, guides, and documentation
├── plans/           # Detailed execution plans for individual tasks
├── scripts/         # Executable scripts (e.g., the Orchestrator)
├── src/             # Source code for project-specific libraries or modules (if any)
├── tasks/           # The main task list and task-feature breakdowns
├── tests/           # Automated tests
│
├── .env.example     # Template for environment variables
├── .gitignore       # Git ignore rules
├── LOCAL_SETUP.md   # User guide for local setup and execution
├── README.md        # High-level project overview and entry point
└── requirements.txt # Python package dependencies
```

## Directory Descriptions

- **`.github/`**: Contains GitHub-specific configuration, such as action workflows for continuous integration and testing.
- **`docs/`**: The central repository for all project documentation. This includes high-level specifications, technical guides, architectural documents, and principles.
  - Examples: `SPEC.md`, `TOOL_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SPECIFICATION_GUIDE.md`, `FEATURES_SPECIFICATION.md`.
  - `FEATURES_SPECIFICATION.md` defines what a Feature is, the feature format, and a canonical catalog of agent features with success criteria. Tasks and features in `tasks/TASKS.md` should reference this file rather than duplicating content.
- **`plans/`**: Stores the detailed, step-by-step plans generated by the agent for completing specific tasks. Each plan should correspond to a task ID.
  - Example: `plan_14.md`.
- **`scripts/`**: Contains standalone, executable scripts. The primary example is the agent's Orchestrator.
  - Example: `run_local_agent.py`.
- **`src/`**: Reserved for Python source code that is not a standalone script but a module or library to be imported by other parts of the project.
- **`tasks/`**: Holds the project's task list with embedded Features. Tasks remain the top-level unit, and each task may include a `Features:` section where features are listed using the feature format defined in `docs/FEATURES_SPECIFICATION.md` and `docs/TASK_FORMAT.md`.
  - Example: `TASKS.md`.
- **`tests/`**: Contains all automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

## File Naming Conventions

To maintain consistency, please adhere to the following naming conventions:

- **Documentation (`.md`)**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.md`
  - Rationale: Distinguishes core specification documents as stable, important artifacts.
  - Example: `FILE_ORGANISATION.md`, `AGENT_PRINCIPLES.md`, `FEATURES_SPECIFICATION.md`.
- **Python Scripts (`.py`)**: `lower_snake_case.py`
  - Rationale: Follows the standard Python PEP 8 style guide.
  - Example: `run_local_agent.py`.
- **Configuration Files**: Use standard names where applicable.
  - Example: `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`.

## Referencing Features from Tasks
- Each task in `tasks/TASKS.md` includes a `Features:` section with locally numbered features (1), 2), 3) ...).
- Features should reference `docs/FEATURES_SPECIFICATION.md` when they align with the canonical feature catalog or when they need to cite shared definitions and success criteria.
- Avoid duplicating detailed behavior in `TASKS.md`; place canonical behavior in the relevant spec files and reference them.

## Future Evolution
This file structure is a living document. As the project evolves, it may be necessary to add new directories or adjust the organization. Any such changes should be proposed via a task and this document should be updated accordingly.
